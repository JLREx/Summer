# Summer-Backend

Server backend for Summer developed by [@Ngwe Jia Le](https://github.com/JLREx) with summarization model finetuned by [@ChunKeatTan](https://github.com/ChunKeatTan)

*Note: The model is not uploaded here due to large file size. It can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11rWeW9R-y7FYD5Ms2UMan92KGV3ayKsz/view?usp=sharing). Put the downloaded model file into this [folder](https://github.com/JLREx/Summer/tree/main/Summer-Backend/summer/summarization/simplet5-epoch-0-train-loss-1.6666-val-loss-1.4172) and follow the user manual in the root folder to setup the backend server. Also, only summarization function will be working as we did not and do not plan to upload the required credential files here.*
